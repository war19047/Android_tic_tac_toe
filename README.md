# Overview

It is amazing how we rely on our phones to get us from point A to B, keep track of our finances, or spend mindless hours being entertained by funny videos. What is even more amazing is how much we don’t think about how these apps actually work. Technology has become so user friendly that we often don’t need to be concerned about how our phones work, which is a good thing. I thought it would be fun to learn about Android apps. Also, phone apps are in huge demand so having experience in app development is a valuable skill to know. I thought well I will just go for it.

I decided to develop Tic Tac Toe because it was a program, I was familiar with. I thought it would be a good starting place in app development. My app consists of a start screen and then once you enter the game a 9x9 board to play on. The program will detect the players turn as well as winning moves.

I want to be a well-rounded developer who can adapt and change to current technologies. When I first started out programming a little over a year ago, I had the mentality that Python was the best and that I only wanted to know Python. I learned that this was not the best mentality to have and that having knowledge in other technologies only makes me a better developer and more well-rounded. I made this app in Kotlin which is a newer language for me, and I have never used Android Studio. I thought this would be a good challenge which it definitely was.
